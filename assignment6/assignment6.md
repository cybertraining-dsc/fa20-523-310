# AI in Consumer Genomics

Genomics is the study of the whole genomes of organisms. The human genome is made up of
23 chromosomal pairs that are encoded by strings of nucleic acid base pairs called DNA, of
which the human genome contains over 3 billion pairs [^1]. Genes are specific structures of DNA
in the chromosomes that encode the synthesis of specific RNA or proteins. And it is this
pathway from DNA to RNA to protein that is the driving concept behind how biology works [^2].
Genomic studies can identify genes that are linked to the development or risk of disease, or
they can predict how individuals might react to specific medicines [^1]. Because of the big
datasets behind genomics, modern AI and cloud computing are required to run the algorithms
that these studies rely on [^6].

Consumer genomics is the application of genomics to a specific individual. For example,
23andMe’s Genetic Weight Report can impart to a user how their genes might impact their
body weight by reporting the number of genes found corresponding to higher body weight, and
the number of genes found corresponding to lower body weight [^1]. The user can then use this
information to inform their lifestyle choices. More enlightening applications of consumer
genomics include identifying or determining the risk for disease and how an individual might
react to medical treatment.

Some early examples of consumer genomics include: ancestry and ethnicity, genetic disease
carrier status, generic wellness information, inherited cancer gene screening, clotting and
cardiovascular disorders screening, periodontal disease screening, weight management, genetic
links to ADHD, and metabolic disease screening.

Some diseases such as hemophilia, sickle-cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and skeletal dysplasia are
directly tied to alterations in a single gene. These diseases are called “Mendelian disorders” and
consumer genomics can report to consumers if they are a carrier of any of these diseases.
Again, this can impart wisdom on to consumers on which they can base life choices. However,
at the current moment, the number of diseases traced back to single gene alterations is quite
small. A much more difficult problem is communicating to consumers the risk of multifactorial
diseases (those that rely on multiple genes, and environmental conditions) [^4].

Current market leading consumer genomic companies use a testing method that only decodes
~0.02% of a customer’s genome [^5]. However, they search for specific sections of the genome
that can impart valuable information such as ancestry data and Mendelian diseases. These
companies have already amassed millions of consumer genomes and their business model
relies on collecting and aggregating this information to sell to researchers, insurers, and
pharmaceutical companies [^4]. But recently, Nebula has made whole genome sequencing (WGS) available for close to $300. As the price of genome sequencing continues to fall, the
quantity and completeness of genomic data is increasing.

This quantity and completeness of genomic data is exciting for future applications, but will also
will be limited by the huge computing and storage resource requirements needed to process
the data. By 2025 it is expected that genomics will surpass the three biggest players in big data:
Twitter, Astronomy, and YouTube [^6]. A complete human genome can take ~90GB of storage
to store [^6], and genomic studies will require access to large number of genomes and other
electronic health information to continue to make advances in personalized medicine. Some
argue that the mass aggregation of genomes will lead to breakthrough statistical associations in
genomes [^7].

Some of the roadblocks for genomic AI innovation include privacy concerns and regulatory
issues. For example, in 2013 the FDA administration stopped 23andMe’s issuance of medically
relevant reports [^7]. Consumers are also weary to depart with their genomic information if
they do not know how it will be used. Nebula is banking on fine grained access control to win
over suspect consumers [^5]. Progress is being made on these roadblocks, and the resulting
mass access to genomic data can potentially revolutionize the medical industry.

Some applications that we can expect to see include pharmacogenomics, and newborn genetic
screening tools [^1]. Pharmacogenomics is the study of how an individual responds to drugs
based on their genomic data [^1]. For example, there is a machine learning based study that
looked to determine a stable dose of tacrolimus in patients who received a kidney transplant
[^1]. Additionally, in [^1] they believe that newborn genetic screening will become standard
practice over the next decade and be incorporated into their electronic health record. Because
of its individual focus, consumer genomics is predicted to usher in an era of personalized
medicine that can result in better individual health outcomes.
